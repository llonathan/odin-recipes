The intend using this project is shown what I've learned with the 37% of the course completed using HTML and Git/Github. I think the way that the course is designed is very insightful about what is needed to faster understand what is about the web programming, the side knowledge sources are also a good complement to the course design. 

The project itself is about creating a recipes webpage containing some links, lists, headers and titles on the links, possibly as a preparation for further projects where this particular website will be revisited with new knowledge, functions and learned tools for programming at a more advanced level.
